using Zurb Foundation 3 - [documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/old-docs/f3/)


### PROBLEM:

Using the Orbit jQuery slider that comes with Zurb Foundation 3. Unfortunately, it's buggy and deals with the "Flash of Unstyled Content". Orbit is fixed in Foundation 4. Unfortunately, a rewrite to Foundation 4 is not an option at this time. 

### POSSIBLE SOLUTION

Look at implement bxslider jquery slider, [http://bxslider.com](http://bxslider.com)
